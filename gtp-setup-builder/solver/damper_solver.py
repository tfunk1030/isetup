"""Step 6: Damper Solver — Pure Physics Approach.

Derives all damper settings from first principles using suspension dynamics,
track surface data, and tyre requirements. NO baseline anchoring — every
value is computed from the physical model.

Physics Foundation:

    A damper converts kinetic energy (suspension movement) into heat.
    The damping force is proportional to shaft velocity:
        F = c * v   (linear model)

    where c = damping coefficient (N·s/m), v = shaft velocity (m/s).

    For a spring-mass-damper system, critical damping is:
        c_crit = 2 * sqrt(k * m)     [N·s/m]

    Damping ratio: ζ = c / c_crit
        ζ < 1.0: underdamped (oscillates)
        ζ = 1.0: critically damped (no oscillation, fastest return)
        ζ > 1.0: overdamped (slow return)

    Racing target: ζ = 0.3 to 0.7 depending on regime:
        LS (body control): ζ ≈ 0.55-0.70  (need to control roll/pitch quickly)
        HS (bump absorption): ζ ≈ 0.25-0.40  (need compliance over bumps)

    Rebound vs Compression:
        Rebound (extension) should produce MORE force than compression
        at equivalent velocities. This is because:
        1. Compression: road hits tyre → tyre must comply → softer damping
        2. Rebound: suspension extends → tyre must stay planted → stiffer damping
        3. Rebound controls oscillation (prevents bouncing after a bump)

        Typical racing ratio: rebound/comp = 1.3-2.0
        At HS: ratio increases because the consequence of a loose rebound
        (wheel bouncing off surface) is worse than stiff compression (wheel
        lifting momentarily).

    HS Slope (digressive characteristic):
        At extreme shaft velocities, the force curve flattens.
        This prevents the damper from "locking up" during the largest
        bump events (p99+). Higher slope = more digressive.

        For bumpy tracks: higher slope (prevent lockup at extreme events)
        For smooth tracks: lower slope (more linear for precision)

    Speed regime boundary:
        LS ≤ 50 mm/s: body motions (roll, pitch, heave)
        HS > 50 mm/s: bump/kerb transients

    iRacing click-to-force model:
        BMW M Hybrid V8: 20 clicks per parameter
        Force model is approximately linear:
            F_click = F_min + (click - 1) * (F_max - F_min) / (N_clicks - 1)
        We calibrate F_min and F_max from two known data points (setups S1, S2).

        The front and rear have VERY different requirements because of
        the asymmetry in spring rates and the car's dynamic behavior:

        Front (ζ ≈ 0.85-0.90):
            The front suspension has LOW spring rate (~30 N/mm wheel rate
            from the torsion bar). Low spring rate → low natural frequency
            → low critical damping coefficient. To control weight transfer
            on corner entry and braking (which generates large forces at
            low shaft velocities), the damping ratio must be HIGH — near
            critical — to prevent excessive dive and roll oscillation.

            At ζ=0.88, the front body settles in <0.5 oscillations after
            a weight transfer event. This gives the driver immediate,
            predictable front-end response on turn-in.

        Rear (ζ ≈ 0.28-0.32):
            The rear has HIGH spring rate (~170 N/mm). High spring rate
            → high natural frequency → high critical damping coefficient.
            The rear needs MUCH less damping ratio because:
            1. The spring itself provides most of the resistance
            2. The driven rear wheels need compliance for traction
            3. Over-damping the rear LS causes snap oversteer on entry
               (the inside rear can't extend fast enough → loses contact)

            At ζ=0.30, the rear is lightly damped — it follows the road
            surface faithfully rather than fighting it.

        The ratio ζ_front/ζ_rear ≈ 2.9 is a direct consequence of the
        spring rate asymmetry: c_crit_rear/c_crit_front ≈ 2.5, so to
        get similar absolute LS force behavior, the ratios must diverge.

        HS events are transient (bumps, kerbs). The key physics:

        - Energy out = damper dissipation + spring storage
        - The damper must absorb enough energy to prevent bottoming
          but not so much that the tyre lifts off (wheel hop)

        Front HS (ζ ≈ 0.45):
            The front handles aero platform control. Moderate HS damping
            prevents pitch oscillation that would disrupt the diffuser
            seal. The front can tolerate momentary tyre unloading because
            the front contributes less to traction than the rear.

        Rear HS (ζ ≈ 0.13-0.15):

            need continuous contact for traction. Over-damped rear HS is
            the most dangerous mode in a GTP car — it causes the rear to
            "skip" over bumps, losing traction unpredictably.

            The compliance ratio rear/front HS (0.14/0.45 ≈ 0.31) is

            - We want the loaded side to be controlled (stiff comp)
